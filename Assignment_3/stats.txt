What case study area did you pick and why?

I chose Mumbai, India, because I'm studying recycling supply and demand there. 

What metrics did you pick and why?

I looked at population, area of each sub-ward polygon, and recycling points--Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs), which aggregate large amounts of trash, and kabadiwalas, which aggregate smaller amounts. I only have kabadiwala data for 3 areas of the city. 

What statistical test did you use and why?

I attempted to make a heat map showing a correlation between a recycling point's location and the nearby population, as a proxy for recyclable material generation in a given area. In other words, if there is a large population in a given area, one would expect to find many kabadiwalas serving the recycling demand in that area. 

Since the heat map did not work, I used a proxy which normalized the population by area. I made a new column showing population per square km and colored the sub-ward polygons based on this metric, showing areas where population density was high. 

What was its result (again not graded for accuracy)?

The heatmap did not draw successfully, so I can't say much about the correlation between recycling points and population. However, from the map, I can see some evidence of there being a correlation.
